Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 3975-3986, doi:10.5194/gmd-8-3975-2015

and updated by Julio Bacmeister for CESM2.2 support (internal smoothing, ridge finding algorithm, etc.)
and variable resolution (Adam Herrington).

Get code:

      git clone https://github.com/NCAR/Topo
      cd Topo

Execute code:

	The raw data (assumed to be on lat-lon grid) 

	The user does not need create_netCDF_from_rawdata/ and bin_to_cube/ steps unless wanting to change
	base dataset. create_netCDF_from_rawdata is currently broken!
	
	The CESM2.2 inteermediate cubed-sphere dataset is located here:

	intermediate_cubed_sphere_file=/glade/p/cgd/amp/aherring/grids/topo/gmted2010_modis-ncube3000-stitch.nc

Type "make"

	Code will compute ne30pg3 dataset by default.

Overview of directories
=======================


0. make_rll_grid_descriptor_file:
---------------------------------

Make grid-descriptor files for regular lat-lon grids

1. bin_to_cube:
---------------

Bin high resolution elevation data (on regular lat-lon grid) onto cubed-sphere grid.
Creates intermediate cubed-sphere data for cube_to_target. This is used to separate
scales for SGH and SGH30.

2. cube_to_target:
------------------

Remap elevation data to target grid and compute associated variables.

3. cesm_meta_data_compliance:
-----------------------------

Python script to add CESM meta data to topography data file (must be done manually: "make cesm_compliance")
(currently broken)
