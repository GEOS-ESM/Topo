and updated by Julio Bacmeister for CESM2.2 support (internal smoothing, ridge finding algorithm, etc.)
and variable resolution (Adam Herrington).


Overview of directories
=======================


bin_to_cube:
------------

Bin high resolution elevation data (on regular lat-lon grid) onto cubed-sphere grid.
Creates intermediate cubed-sphere data for cube_to_target. This is used to separate
scales for SGH and SGH30.

Note: The user does not need bin_to_cube step unless wanting to change
      source dataset and/or intermediate cubed-sphere resolution.


cube_to_target:
---------------

Code to process elevation data and remap to target grid.

List namelist options: Execute ./cube_to_target --help

Software will produce plot.sh which can be used to produce NCL plots of topography data
(source plot.sh)

Default interemdiate cubed-sphere data on Cheyenne is located at

	/glade/p/cgd/amp/pel/topo/cubedata/gmted2010_modis_bedmachine-ncube3000-220518.nc

Example:

See cubed_to_target/ne30pg3.sh. Execute (on Cheyenne) with:

    qcmd -l walltime=04:00:00 -- source ne30pg3.sh

Fast regression tests:

    source regr_test1.sh     (fast version of ne30pg3.sh but using ncube=540 intermediate cubed-sphere grid data)
    source regr_test2.sh     (low resolution variable resolution test using ncube=540 intermediate cubed-sphere grid data)
    source regr_test2_lap.sh (same as regr_test2.sh but using Laplacian smoother)
    source regr_test3.sh     (low resolution test for lat-lon grid using ncube=540 intermediate cubed-sphere grid data)


regression-test-data:
---------------------

Data used for regression tests in cubed_to_target. See above.

make_rll_grid_descriptor_file:
------------------------------

Code to make SCRIP grid descriptor files for regular latitude-longitude grids
