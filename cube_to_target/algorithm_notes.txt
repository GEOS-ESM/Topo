Leading upto - made many changes related to correct expansion/contraction
of windows w/ repsect to metrics on cubed sphere. Re-enabled variable res
ridge finding and set up more efficient smoothing that starts from
pre-computed smooth topo on coarse outer grids.  This is all in tags
v5.0.. - v6.0...


Now going to work on ridge finding some.  Changed "seeding" added -a option
to control this.  New (better?) seeding '-a 2' isn't based on maxes of 
topo_dev file rather seeds with topo_dev>10m contour on bloc X bloc squares
where bloc=NINT(nsw/8.).

Toying with itrative ANISO_ANA but may need to straigthen out x,y
coordiantes in ridge finding. ...
